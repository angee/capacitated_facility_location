# Capacitated facility location

Code for solving the single-source capacitated facility location problem (SCFLP).


### Problem summary

Given a set of facilities F and a set of clients S, where the facilities are able to supply the
clients with a commodity for which they have a demand. The problem is to decide which facilities 
to build/open to meet a specific client demand, minimizing the overall costs. The overall cost 
are composed of two cost sources: (1) the cost of opening the respective facilities, and (2) the 
costs that arise when the respective facilities meet the client's demand (e.g. production and 
transportation costs).
